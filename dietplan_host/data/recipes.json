Gently warm the butter with the milk in a small saucepan over a low heat until the butter has just melted (but don’t let the milk boil).\n# Put the flour, sugar, yeast, egg and 1/ 2 tsp salt in a freestanding mixer with dough hook attachment. While the machine runs on a slow speed, pour in the warm milk and butter. Knead for 5 mins until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl. Using floured hands, transfer to a lightly floured bowl, cover with cling film and leave in the fridge to prove overnight. (If you don’t have a free-standing mixer, mix the ingredients in a large bowl and knead the dough on a floured surface for 10 mins until smooth.)\n# To make the mayonnaise, put the egg yolk, mustard and some seasoning in a small bowl. Very slowly, drop by drop, gradually pour in the oil, whisking continuously so that the ingredients emulsify. If your mayonnaise begins to look a little thick, add a drop of water to loosen it. Add the vinegar, then season again to taste. Cover with cling film and put in the fridge. The mayonnaise and dough can be made the day before\n# The next day, briefly knead the dough on a floured surface to knock out the air. Divide the dough into 20 equal pieces and shape into balls. Put on a baking tray, cover loosely with cling film and leave to prove for 3-4 hrs in a warm place until doubled in size.\n# Next, prepare the crab. You need only the white leg and claw meat, but save the brown meat in the body of the crab for another time (see above). Use a sharp knife to crack open the claws and legs, and pries out all the white meat.\n# Line your work surface with cling film. Tip out the crabmeat and pick through it to check for shell fragments. If there is any shell, it should get stuck to the cling film.\n# Put the crabmeat in a small bowl, add the mayonnaise and lemon juice, and then season to taste. Cover and put in the fridge until needed.\n# Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or large heavy-based saucepan to 180C or until a piece of bread browns in 20 secs. Working in batches, fry the doughnuts for 2-3 mins until cooked through and deep golden-brown. Drain them on kitchen paper.\n# When cool enough to handle, split the doughnuts nearly in half, leaving them attached at the base (this makes them easier to eat). Fill with the crab mixture and decorate with lemon zest and micro herbs or cress. For further info about how to deep-fry safely see our guide. ",

    "cooking": "# Read directions and watch the video before starting- this recipe can be tricky.\n# In a medium pot, over high heat, add rinsed white quinoa, salt, garlic powder, cumin, dried herbs, olive oil, and stir. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat to low, and simmer gently for 20 minutes.  Set timer.\n# While the quinoa is cooking make the Tomato Chickpea Relish, stirring all ingredients together in a medium bowl.\n# Check quinoa- making sure all the water is gone. If not, continue cooking covered, 5 more minutes, and until steam holes appear (this usually takes me a total of 25 minutes) and quinoa has soaked up all the water and looks fairly dry.)  It is important that quinoa is dry-ish and not watery. Be patient here, all stoves are different. \n# While it’s still warm, stir the quinoa vigorously with a fork, for a one whole minute, until you begin to see the individual grains break apart. This is imperative, to getting the quinoa to bind. Eventually, after a full minute of stirring, the grains will break apart and begin to clump. You can visually see this. Remove from stove, let cool down in the pot to where it’s cool enough to handle with your hands, about 15 minutes.  Stir in the lemon zest and fresh parsley if you like.\n# Using wet hands shape into 4 balls, the size of a tennis ball. Place on a plate or sheet pan.  Using wet hands press into a 1 – 1 1/2 inch thick cake (about 3-4 inches wide), smoothing any cracks on the edges, and making them nice and tidy. Wet hands are a key to this recipe.\n# Refrigerate 15 minutes to set. As the quinoa cakes cool they will become even sturdier. (These will keep 3-4 days if made ahead, just lightly oil them, cover, and store in the fridge.)\n# Gently Pan-sear the Quinoa Cakes in a well-oiled skillet (using a thin metal spatula to flip) over medium heat.  You can pan-sear them without any coating, or for an extra crispy crust, dredge in rice flour or GF Panko. I often do these without any coating at all. Just be sure to not fiddle with them- letting them develop a good crust before flipping. As then develop the crust, they will naturally release themselves from the pan. I like to use a thin metal spatula to flip (more precise).\n# You can also bake these in a toaster oven (right on the rack) or in a 400F oven (on a parchment-lined pan) until warmed through, about 20 minutes, but the crust for a skillet gives these the BEST texture.\n# Divide among plates and top with the fresh tomato chickpea relish.  Spoon any remaining dressing over top and around the cakes.",

If the mixture is getting dry, add more water. If it’s too thin, keep cooking until you get the thickness you want. There is no ‘right’ consistency; dhal can be almost brothy or like a thick purée.\n# To serve, heat the ghee or butter in a pan and add the shallots. Fry until they’re golden, then add the cumin seeds, black mustard seeds and chilli flakes. Cook until their aromas are released. Scatter coriander on top of the dhal, then pour over the spiced butter.",

Put paper towels on top and set aside while you make and chill the pastry.\n# For the pastry, beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until just mixed. Break in a whole egg and a yolk (keep the white for glazing later). Beat together for just under 1 min – it will look a bit like scrambled egg. Now work in the flour with a wooden spoon, a third at a time, until it’s beginning to clump up, then finish gathering it together with your hands. Gently work the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film, and chill for 45 mins. Now mix the 140g/5oz sugar, the cinnamon and flour for the filling in a bowl that is large enough to take the apples later.\n# After the pastry has chilled, heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Lightly beat the egg white with a fork. Cut off a third of the pastry and keep it wrapped while you roll out the rest, and use this to line a pie tin – 20-22cm round and 4cm deep – leaving a slight overhang. Roll the remaining third to a circle about 28cm in diameter. Pat the apples dry with kitchen paper, and tip them into the bowl with the cinnamon-sugar mix. Give a quick mix with your hands and immediately pile high into the pastry-lined tin.\n# Brush a little water around the pastry rim and lay the pastry lid over the apples pressing the edges together to seal. Trim the edge with a sharp knife and make 5 little slashes on top of the lid for the steam to escape. (Can be frozen at this stage.) Brush it all with the egg white and sprinkle with caster sugar. Bake for 40-45 mins, until golden, then remove and let it sit for 5-10 mins. Sprinkle with more sugar and serve while still warm from the oven with softly whipped cream.",

    "cooking": "# Read directions and watch the video before starting- this recipe can be tricky.\n# In a medium pot, over high heat, add rinsed white quinoa, salt, garlic powder, cumin, dried herbs, olive oil, and stir. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat to low, and simmer gently for 20 minutes.  Set timer.\n# While the quinoa is cooking make the Tomato Chickpea Relish, stirring all ingredients together in a medium bowl.\n# Check quinoa- making sure all the water is gone. If not, continue cooking covered, 5 more minutes, and until steam holes appear (this usually takes me a total of 25 minutes) and quinoa has soaked up all the water and looks fairly dry.)  It is important that quinoa is dry-ish and not watery. Be patient here, all stoves are different. \nWhile it’s still warm, stir the quinoa vigorously with a fork, for a one whole minute, until you begin to see the individual grains break apart. This is imperative, to getting the quinoa to bind. Eventually, after a full minute of stirring, the grains will break apart and begin to clump. You can visually see this. Remove from stove, let cool down in the pot to where it’s cool enough to handle with your hands, about 15 minutes.  Stir in the lemon zest and fresh parsley if you like.\n# Using wet hands, shape into 4 balls, the size of a tennis ball. Place on a plate or sheet pan.  Using wet hands press into a 1 – 1 1/2 inch thick cake (about 3-4 inches wide), smoothing any cracks on the edges, making them nice and tidy. Wet hands is key.\n# Refrigerate 15 minutes to set. As the quinoa cakes cool they will become even more sturdy. (These will keep 3-4 days if made ahead, just lightly oil them, cover, and store in the fridge.)\n# Gently Pan-sear the Quinoa Cakes in a well-oiled skillet (using a thin metal spatula to flip) over medium heat.  You can pan-sear them without any coating, or for an extra crispy crust, dredge in rice flour or GF Panko. I often do these without any coating at all. Just be sure to not fiddle with them- letting them develop a good crust before flipping. As then develop the crust, they will naturally release themselves from the pan. I like to use a thin metal spatula to flip (more precise).\n# You can also bake these in a toaster oven ( right on the rack) or in a 400F  oven ( on a parchment-lined pan) until warmed through, about 20 minutes, but the crust for a skillet gives these the BEST texture.\n# Divide among plates and top with the fresh tomato chickpea relish.  Spoon any remaining dressing over top and around the cakes.\n# Garnish with OPTIONAL crumbled goat cheese if you like or a balsamic glaze.",

Bake for 26-30 minutes. You’re looking for golden brown edges and a texture that’s firm to the touch. The longer it bakes, the firmer and crispier it will become, so if you’re looking for softer tofu remove from the oven around the 26-28 minute mark. I prefer crispy tofu, so I bake mine the full 30 minutes. Set aside.\n# While the tofu bakes prepare your rice by bringing 12 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Once boiling, add rinsed rice and stir. Boil on high uncovered for 30 minutes, then strain for 10 seconds and return to pot removed from the heat. Cover with a lid and let steam for 10 minutes*.\n# While rice and tofu are cooking, prepare sauce by adding all ingredients to a medium-size mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more tamari or soy sauce for saltiness, peanut butter for creaminess, brown sugar for sweetness, or chili garlic sauce for heat.\n# Once the tofu is done baking, add directly to the sauce and marinate for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n# Heat a large metal or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, use a slotted spoon to scoop the tofu into the pan leaving most of the sauce behind. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown on all sides (see photo). Lower heat if browning too quickly. Remove from pan and set aside.\n# To the still hot pan add garlic, green onion, peas and carrots. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, and season with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) tamari or soy sauce (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).\n# Add cooked rice, tofu, and remaining sauce and stir.

Once hot, pour half of the omelette batter into the center of the pan, trying to make a circle. You can use a spatula to encourage it to spread, sort of like a pancake.

At this point, if for some reason it was thicker than you thought or it's not cooked all the way through, you can carefully flip the omelette over and cook the other side for 1-2 minutes.\n# Add any fillings you want (I used cooked onions, mushrooms, spinach and daiya cheddar shreds) to one half of the omelette, then fold one side over to cover the fillings.

Stir briefly just until thickened and remove from the water. Using the tines of a whip-style whisk or a fork, very carefully drizzle thin strands of the hot syrup onto the greased upturned muffin tins, creating a lovely mess of strands.

Use caution when handling and wear kitchen gloves if you have them. \n# Let the drizzled syrup rest for about 15 seconds or until only slightly warm to the touch.

In a separate, smaller mixing bowl mix the sorghum flour, cocoa powder, potato starch, xanthan gum, and baking soda until well combined.\n# Gradually incorporate the flour mixture into the sugar mixture until crumbly. Once crumbly, add the non dairy milk until completely combined. If using an electric mixer, just let it ride on low as you add the non dairy milk. Your dough should get quite stiff at this point.\n# Shape into a rectangular log, about 2 × 10 inches, using the help of parchment paper and a bench scraper/offset spatula to flatten and form the sides. Wrap loosely with parchment paper and chill in the freezer for 30 minutes, until very cold.\n# Preheat oven to 350°F. Once the dough is well chilled, cut the log in half, making two even-sized bricks (about 2 × 5 inches each). Flip each brick on its side, and then slice evenly into rectangles about 2 × 3 inches and about ⅛ inch thick to emulate a cookie from a store-bought ice cream sandwich.\n# As you slice the cookies, place each slab of thin dough gently onto parchment paper or a silpat mat.\n# Bake in preheated oven for 14 to 16 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely at room temperature. Transfer to the freezer just before assembling and chill for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, soften your chosen ice cream for about 10 minutes, or until easily scoopable.\n# To assemble, take one cookie, and plop a few spoonfuls of your favorite ice cream on top. Smoosh down the ice cream with another cookie and run a spoon around the edge to ensure even distribution of ice cream.\n# Return sandwiches to freezer and chill until firm. Once firm, neatly wrap them in waxed paper to store. Keeps for up to 3 months frozen.\n",

Cook until golden brown and then gently remove.\n# To make waffle cones: Using an oven mitt or heat-safe gloved hands, gently shape the cookie into a cone and snugly place in a safe spot to cool, for about 1 hour. Watch that they don’t unravel before cooling or they will become stuck in that shape. Let cool completely, and then serve with your favorite frozen treat. Store in airtight container for up to 3 weeks.\n\n",

    "cooking": "# Preheat the oven to 180°C (350 F) /gas mark 4. Line a 23cm (9-inch) round cake tin with baking parchment.\n# Place all the dry ingredients for the vegan sponge in a large bowl and mix together with a small balloon whisk. Measure out the wet ingredients into a jug and again mix together with the whisk. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture and mix until well combined, then pour into the lined cake tin. Bake for 30 minutes until well risen and the sponge springs back to the touch.\n# Remove from the oven and leave to cool for a few minutes in the tin, then turn out on to a wire rack and leave to cool completely.\n# To make the custard, put all the ingredients, except the corn flour, in a pan and heat gently, stirring frequently, until warm.\n# Mix the corn flour with enough cold water to make a smooth paste. Add to the almond milk mixture and cook for a few minutes, stirring until thickened. Remove the pan from the heat. You can strain the custard through a sieve to remove any lumps. Leave to cool.\n# To make the raspberry compote, put half the berries with the remaining ingredients in a saucepan and bring up to a simmer. Cook gently for 10–15 minutes, stirring frequently, until the berries have totally broken down and the liquid is glossy.\n# Take the pan off the heat, leave the compote to cool a little then blend with a stick blender. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the seeds, then mix with the remaining berries.\n# To assemble, cut the sponge into slices 2.5cm (0, 9 inch) thick and use to line the base of a glass trifle dish, 20cm (7.8 inch) in diameter with a flat base, evenly. Pour the sherry evenly over the sponge, then spoon over an even layer of raspberry compote.\n# Leave in the refrigerator for 20 minutes or so to settle before carefully spooning over the custard. Cover and leave the custard to set in the refrigerator for a few hours.\n# When the custard is almost set, make the coconut whipped cream. Open the can of coconut milk and scoop off the thick cream from the top (usually around 200g (7 oz)) into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Do the same if using creamed coconut, although there will be less liquid.\n# Sift the icing sugar into the bowl and add the vanilla, if using. Whisk on a fairly high speed until the mixture comes together, being careful not to over whip.\n# Pipe the freshly whipped coconut cream on top of the trifle. Alternatively, add in small spoonful’s and spread out evenly across the top, then heat the spoon in hot water and use it to smooth the surface of the cream. Finally, scatter with the toasted almonds and decorate with the raspberries if you like.\n\n\n",

(Don’t worry if you lose a few in the cutting process.) Lay the slices carefully on the lined baking sheet and bake for a further 20 minutes, flipping over halfway through.\n# Remove from the oven and leave to cool, then drizzle with the melted chocolate, if you like.\n# To turn the crème caramels out, hold each mould with your hand over the top and give the caramel a small firm shake from side to side. It should loosen inside the mould. Place a plate on top and turn both the mould and plate over together. ",

Cover the bowl, and set aside for 30 to 60 minutes or until the dough is moist but no longer sticky.\n# Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). Thoroughly oil ten 3-inch tartlet pans, and press the dough evenly into each, trimming excess dough from the edges. Prick the bottoms with a fork several times, place the tart pans on a baking sheet and bake until golden and fragrant, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool.\n# Filling: Line a medium strainer with a thin kitchen towel or several layers of cheesecloth, and place it over a medium pot; set aside. Blend 2 1/2 cups water and the almonds in a blender until smooth. Pour the almond milk through the lined strainer into a pot. Gather the edges of the cloth, and gently squeeze out the milk; discard the dry pulp that remains. Add the maple syrup, agar flakes and salt to the almond milk, and whisk to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, whisking every minute or so. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low and simmer until all the agar is dissolved, about 15 minutes. Combine the arrowroot with 1 tablespoon water, and slowly drizzle the mixture into the simmering liquid. When the liquid returns to a simmer, remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the vanilla.\n# Carefully remove the crusts from the pans. Pour 1/4 cup of the warm filling into each tart shell. Place the tartlets on a flat tray, set aside until the filling has stopped steaming, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until ready to serve.\n# Topping: Bring the cranberries, orange juice, maple syrup and cinnamon to a boil in a small pot. Stir the mixture, cover the pot, reduce the heat to low and simmer for until the cranberries are soft, 5 minutes. Dissolve the arrowroot in 2 teaspoons water, and slowly drizzle the arrowroot mixture into the cranberry mixture. Remove the pan from the heat once the mixture has returned to a simmer. Let cool. Top each tartlet with a spoonful of the cranberry mixture, and serve.\n# TIPS AND SUBSTITUTIONS: Makes 10 (3-inch) (7 cm) tarts Special equipment: ten 3-inch tartlet pans, preferably with removable bottoms.\n# Although rolled oats do not contain gluten, they are processed in facilities that also process grains with gluten. If you're making these for someone with a severe gluten allergy, be sure to use certified gluten-free oats and oat flour.\n# Using freshly toasted almonds in these tartlets gives the best flavour. Spread raw whole almonds over a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer. Place in a preheated 300ºF (150ºC) oven, and bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until the inside is a shade darker. Let cool.\n",

Chill for at least 1 hour.\n# Position an oven rack in the lowest position in the oven, place a baking sheet on the rack and preheat to 425ºF (220ºC); preheat for at least 30 minutes. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet, and lower the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). Bake until the pie is golden and the filling is bubbly, 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes, rotating as needed. (Cover the edges with foil if they brown too quickly.) Transfer to a rack, and cool until set, about 3 hours.\n",
