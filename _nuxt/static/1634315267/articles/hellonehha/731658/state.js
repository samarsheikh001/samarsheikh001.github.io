They went deep into the accessibility and also discuss how my code is meeting the accessibility.\n\n6) Web Security: I was not having much experience in this but due to my current project I got the chance to learn about this...hence able to answer.\n\n7) Nodejs and Database:\n\n8) Data Structure\n\n9) System design\n\n10) How to do code reviews\n\nOverall if you are working day today as a developer you will find most of the questions are doable and not so hard.\n\n### Leadership round\n\nThis round is very important for me as I am going to be a part of the leadership and working closely with them. As well as, there is no right answer in this round. For me, this round is always the deal breaker...I want to join the company or not by talking to the leaders (PS: I also keep an eye on the vibes interviewers are giving during interviews. I don't want to work with folks who can't make someone comfortable in an interview)\n\nGenerally, Here I speak aloud about my way of working as a manager. Such as for me empathy and work-life balance come first for my team members.\n\nIf my team is happy and comfortable to work they will go the extra mile to do their work. I don't do micro-management. I trust folks, etc...\n\n\n### Preparation\n\nThe only preparation I did was doing pair programming and discussing DSA with my friends. Rest of the technical part I was doing at my day-to-day job.\n\nI was not at all confident in DSA but I would say it was my luck the interviews I cleared asked only that part which I knew already.\n\n\n## 9. Why did you decide to move ahead?\n\nA- As I mentioned that I was already planning to start looking for a change after 2.5+ years in my current place. The reason was to get myself to extend my domains, especially in Cloud and Backend. At my current place, I was not getting this opportunity and yes the finance part was also what I expected. So, I decided to move ahead.\n\n\n### You can connect with me at [Linkedin](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.linkedin.com\u002Fin\u002Fnehha\u002F) or follow me at [Twitter](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fhellonehha)",user:{name:"Neha Sharma ",username:e,twitter_username:e,github_username:"Neha",website_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fnehasharma.dev",profile_image:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fpracticaldev\u002Fimage\u002Ffetch\u002Fs--LPotDxkP--\u002Fc_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_640,q_auto,w_640\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Fuser\u002Fprofile_image\u002F118962\u002F382c4db7-91d3-4e27-9cd5-a1e0331587b0.jpg",profile_image_90:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fpracticaldev\u002Fimage\u002Ffetch\u002Fs--m7kvcExk--\u002Fc_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_90,q_auto,w_90\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Fuser\u002Fprofile_image\u002F118962\u002F382c4db7-91d3-4e27-9cd5-a1e0331587b0.jpg"}}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Farticles\u002Fhellonehha\u002F731658",config:{_app:{basePath:"\u002F",assetsPath:"\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:a}}}}(null,"2021-06-18T03:06:00Z","https:\u002F\u002Fdev.to\u002Fhellonehha\u002Fmy-interview-experience-of-engineering-manager-2jb7",18,"hellonehha"));
