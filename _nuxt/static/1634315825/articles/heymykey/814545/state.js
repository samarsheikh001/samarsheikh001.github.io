I recently started working at a restaurant, after a few weeks I told the Owner I'm a Web developer side note I really wanted to introduce myself as a Software Engineer. So she decided to hire me to build a restaurant website for her frontend and backend. This was my first client, I was excited so excited that imposter syndrome hit me. The tools I used for the frontend were mainly bootstrap and a few lines of CSS here and there and a library for a few frameworks. I am currently working on the backend now and again my archenemy imposter syndrome is coming for me again. The restaurant owner wants to be able to take orders online, My biggest fear is security and poor design causing a slow backend. The tools I'm using for the backend are Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and a few other libraries or frameworks. As of right now, I'm working on adding all the menu items and their prices to the database.
