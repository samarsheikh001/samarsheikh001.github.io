For example, a [ gallery of images](https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F35_image_carousel) ,  [a loading icon](https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F23_kinetic_css_loader) , a  [to-do list](https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F49_todo_list) , a  [notes app](https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F33_notes_app) ,  [a background slider](https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F18_background_slider) ,  [drag and drop effects](https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F21_drag_n_drop) , a  [landing page]( https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F07_split_landing_page) , a  [password generator](https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F31_password_generator) ,  [testimonials](https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F47_testimonial_box_switcher) , etc.\n\nEvery mini project is a feature that you can include in a social media app, a productivity website, features you can do at work, or if you are not thinking about a specific product, you can do it to include it on your portfolio and show it to the recruiter in the company you apply to get a job.\n\n## 5. Have fun\n\nI think this is the most important recommendation, 'cause if you're not enjoying what you're doing in coding, maybe a software development job is not for you. I know from some friends that are developers, that sometimes they can be very stressed about their jobs, but they explain to me how exciting is to find a solution to a bug or create a special feature that looks and works really nice in a company's website.\n\nSomebody said that if you choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life, maybe Confucius wasn't right or maybe he was, but the point is that while you're learning, you need to feel happy about what you create.\n\nIn the course we did some funny projects too, I learned and also I laughed at some projects such as the [Dad's jokes generator](https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F10_dad_jokes), the  [insect catch game](https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F50_insect_catch_game)  or the  [Pokedex](https:\u002F\u002F50daysproject.vercel.app\u002Fprojects\u002F37_pokedex).\n\nThe course helped me a lot on how to practice many things, something new I've learned is how to make API request in JavaScript, and even though, it's still a hard topic for me, I find fun in it, because I know I can create new things from that knowledge.\n\nKeep on practicing, it may be hard, but if you really want to switch careers, you'll put your efforts into it. In the end, you'll feel satisfied with what you have learned. We have a saying in Spanish that says \"El que sabe se divierte\" which means \"The one that knows how to do it, has fun\", so, if you want to enjoy your career, first you need to put your efforts into learning and you'll get it.\n",user:{name:"David Salomón",username:"davidsalomondev",twitter_username:"davidsalomon777",github_username:"DavidSalomonDev",website_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fblog.davidsalomon.dev",profile_image:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fpracticaldev\u002Fimage\u002Ffetch\u002Fs--146i5wSu--\u002Fc_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_640,q_auto,w_640\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Fuser\u002Fprofile_image\u002F401928\u002F735cc898-fbf2-46d5-adfa-5de0aaef8541.jpeg",profile_image_90:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fpracticaldev\u002Fimage\u002Ffetch\u002Fs--foq_y7nH--\u002Fc_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_90,q_auto,w_90\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Fuser\u002Fprofile_image\u002F401928\u002F735cc898-fbf2-46d5-adfa-5de0aaef8541.jpeg"}}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Farticles\u002Fdavidsalomondev\u002F602090",config:{_app:{basePath:"\u002F",assetsPath:"\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:a}}}}(null,"2021-02-13T01:45:34Z",41));
