You’re a web developer\n\nOne of the best reasons to choose Ionic is if you’re a web developer and want to stay in the web development world. The Ionic stack is built on standard web development technologies meaning you can build the majority of your app directly in a browser and use standard browser development tools and technologies, while still deploying and building a traditional native app.\n\nOther cross-platform toolkits don’t use the web development stack so aren’t the best fit for web developers.\n\n## 2.

You have existing web experiences and investments\n\nBecause the Ionic stack is based around standard web development, it’s the only cross-platform solution that supports bringing existing web experiences, libraries, and other web code into an app.\n\nThis is particularly important for enterprises or teams with a heavy web presence that want to bring those experiences into existing apps, such as traditional native apps.\n\n## 5. You want to join a massive community of developers\n\nBuilding apps with popular technologies makes it easier to hire for, easier to find partners, and easier to find resources on the web as you build your app.\n\nThe [Ionic developer community](https:\u002F\u002Fionicframework.com\u002Fcommunity) is massive, with millions of developers around the world having built apps on the stack.
