I’m going to take a week off this month. And it will be hard, but I’ve already got ideas for what I’m going to do. (One will involve heavy weights.) But honestly, it’s important. I love this community with my whole heart, and they’ve seen my tears more than a handful of times because I give them the fullness of myself.

I am thankful for the community members who support each other. I am thankful for those around me who realize that I’m struggling, but I don’t know how to verbalize it.

We know that growth comes at all levels and that no matter what stage of the developer journey you’re on, you can teach and learn.\n\nI have lived through a lot of growth in the last year, because accidentally starting a community during a pandemic can force that on you. I learned a lot about myself, and a lot about community, and I’m sharing this because a lot of that time was incredibly fulfilling and a lot of that time was lonely; and I’ve had a hard time finding people who are talking about the three Ls: learning, loneliness, and loveliness.\n\n## Learning\n\n### What I’ve learned\n\n- I’ve learned that sometimes it is a joy to give and share with people.\n\n- That trusting the people you’re collaborating with is so important.\n\n- That you should be able to argue and disagree with the people you trust.\n\n- That I am energized by other people’s energy.\n\n- That sometimes things will work out like you anticipate and other times they most definitely do _not_.\n\n- That a supported community will form their own subcommunities within your group and be amazing while doing it.\n\n- That sometimes the members you think are confident are silently struggling.\n\n- That sometimes you have to trust your gut feeling. You know it’s not right, but you can’t explain why. And for me, most times my gut has been right.\n\n- That the best education you can get will happen when you reach out and ask for it.\n\nI am either intensely shy or I go for it.

Four years ago, I never would’ve expected that I would be this person. I never would’ve guessed I’d even be a developer. I don’t believe in the impossible. I embrace it as a challenge._\n\n### What I’m Still Learning\n\n- That a _yes_ can be a no to a hundred other things.\n\n- That sometimes honesty hurts, but the people around you deserve honesty.\n\n- That I don’t need to be an expert.\n\n- That asking for help is normal.\n\n- That sometimes your gut feeling will be wrong, and that’s ok. You learn from that experience and take it with you to the next. Sometimes it’s messy. Sometimes it puts you behind where you expect to be, but it puts you ahead for the next time it happens.\n\n## Loneliness\n\n### On Getting Through the Hard Times\n\nWhen you accidentally start a community, you accidentally become the leader, and then you give your time and sometimes your money to make sure the community keeps going.\n\nAnd suddenly you find that you’ve been giving every ounce of yourself, and you’re tired.

And I got nothing but support.\n\nTaking time off is not an easy thing for me to do, but when we interviewed [Tom Cudd](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Ftomcudd) for the Virtual Coffee podcast, he talked about how he set the example for his team with his work habits. And it was validation. Because I’ll tell members to practice self-care and to refuse to work more than 40 hours a week, but the truth is, I’m bad at setting that boundary for myself.\n\nVirtual Coffee isn’t a job, and I haven’t made any money doing it, but I spend a lot of my time developing the community, meeting with people who can help me understand how to support our members, developing events and processes and docs and topics that encourage growth and mentorship at all stages.\n\nAnd so I’m going to do it. I’m going to take a week off this month. And it will be hard, but I’ve already got ideas for what I’m going to do. (One will involve heavy weights.) But honestly, it’s important. I love this community with my whole heart, and they’ve seen my tears more than a handful of times because I give them the fullness of myself. But I also need to allow myself time to focus on my personal growth as well.\n\nI could spend hours talking about what I’ve learned in the last year, but I am very thankful that I’ve done it with Virtual Coffee. I am thankful for the DMs I get encouraging me. I am thankful for the kindness that everyone shares. I am thankful for the support of my fellow maintainers. I am thankful for the community members who support each other. I am thankful for those around me who realize that I’m struggling, but I don’t know how to verbalize it. And I am thankful for the subtle moments of acceptance. Because those have been the ones that have powered me through this intensely challenging year.";b.user={name:a,username:"bekahhw",twitter_username:a,github_username:a,website_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fbekahhw.github.io\u002F",profile_image:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fpracticaldev\u002Fimage\u002Ffetch\u002Fs--70NJXeRV--\u002Fc_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_640,q_auto,w_640\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Fuser\u002Fprofile_image\u002F345658\u002Fa72b6b8b-b954-47fb-8919-ab380905f26b.jpg",profile_image_90:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fpracticaldev\u002Fimage\u002Ffetch\u002Fs--7Ds1FVu_--\u002Fc_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_90,q_auto,w_90\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Fuser\u002Fprofile_image\u002F345658\u002Fa72b6b8b-b954-47fb-8919-ab380905f26b.jpg"};b.organization={name:"Virtual Coffee",username:g,slug:g,profile_image:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fpracticaldev\u002Fimage\u002Ffetch\u002Fs--lHykUh8R--\u002Fc_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_640,q_auto,w_640\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Forganization\u002Fprofile_image\u002F3610\u002F42d75122-d731-47ba-9473-cf192c6293a6.png",profile_image_90:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fpracticaldev\u002Fimage\u002Ffetch\u002Fs--20QiT3Ys--\u002Fc_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_90,q_auto,w_90\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Forganization\u002Fprofile_image\u002F3610\u002F42d75122-d731-47ba-9473-cf192c6293a6.png"};return {data:[{}],fetch:{"data-v-25febe66:0":{article:b}},mutations:[["SET_CURRENT_ARTICLE",b]]}}("BekahHW",{},"https:\u002F\u002Fdev.to\u002Fvirtualcoffee\u002Fone-year-of-community-the-three-ls-of-an-accidental-community-creator-2h8p",19,null,"2021-04-03T04:12:49Z","virtualcoffee")));
