They are continuously taking in our surroundings, analyzing information and when we experience something repeatedly, our brain begins noticing what is important.  It will sort through and highlight the relevant cues, and add that information for future use.  Our brains encode the lessons learned through experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why it is always best to practice what you are learning.

This will make it easier to remember certain aspects of what you are learning.  You won't memorize it all immediately but you will begin to understand aspects you didn't before.  \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most surprising insights about habits is that we don't need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin.  This is why the first full step towards building good\u002Fbetter habits begins with awareness. An effective way of gaining awareness of your habits is to use a system called \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPointing-and-Calling\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPointing-and-Calling is effective because it forces you to become aware of what you are actively doing bringing the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.

After we do something repeatedly so many times, we begin to overlook things.  We make assumptions that everything will work like the last time.  In the Miltary we train soldiers based on repetition, commit things to muscle memory so that in the fight or flight moment your body acts and you don't have to consciously think about what you are doing.  We also train soldiers about complacency and spot checks repeatedly to ensure we aren't overlooking things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need to build a system like this in our developer lives as well.
