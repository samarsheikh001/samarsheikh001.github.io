Many of them try to become similar to JIRA because this famous platform offers useful tools for project management and collaboration.\n\nA [product roadmap](https:\u002F\u002Fhygger.io\u002Fuse-cases\u002Fproduct-roadmap\u002F) is one of the most requested and useful tools in the world of project management, which helps managers and teams visualize their plans, tasks, milestones, and project stages without losing sight of anything. What do you know about an online product roadmap? Is it an indispensable tool in your work?\n\nToday, many powerful PM software solutions offer reliable roadmaps, including Jira. However, are they that good at Jira, or are there more interesting alternatives? In this post, we try to figure this out.\n\n##What is a Product Roadmap?##\nIn general meaning, a roadmap is a guide that describes all the steps you need to take to move from your current location to your desired destination. In product management, a product roadmap is a plan of action that lines up a product’s short-term and long-term goals and outlines how they will be achieved.\n\n![Alt Text](https:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Farticles\u002F9v5ztpfwvafvxih1wxum.jpg)\n\nProduct Roadmaps document the planned changes for product strategy, direction, and features over a given time frame.\n \nDifferent organizations and teams can have different timelines, that is why product roadmaps can span a variety of timeframes.\nHaving a roadmap is critical for getting management buy-in and project funding. It is often used when you present to an audience about your plans for the future for your product or even company goals.\n\nProduct roadmaps are usually designed with the help of [Gantt Charts](https:\u002F\u002Fhygger.io\u002Fuse-cases\u002Fgantt-chart-maker\u002F).\n\n###Why you need to create and maintain a product roadmap###\nAn efficient product roadmap is designed to serve a product strategy. This strategy mandates that you choose one viable alternative out of many and that you say no to many other alternatives.\n\nRoadmaps force you to take your journey one step at a time, meaning that you will take a specific step in a specific sequence. This ensures that your team has a structured plan to follow.\nAs your team works through product development, you’ll get new info that will validate or disprove your current hypotheses. Therefore you will iterate through new versions of the product roadmap.\n\nRoadmaps meant for your immediate product development teams and are reliable tools for aligning internal stakeholders with the direction that your product is headed.\n\nBy sharing them with customers, you can gather feedback from them on why certain items should be added or removed. In many cases, you can use roadmaps to sell or persuade clients to buy the current offering so that they can be part of upcoming improvements or features down the line.\n\n###How to use a roadmap?###\nIn order to enable a roadmap for your next project, go to the project sidebar and choose Roadmap in the features list. From this page, you can enable\u002Fdisable the roadmap feature.\n\nProduct owners, while building roadmaps, should weigh up customer insights as well as the team’s goals and targets. After that, the team can begin prioritizing work. It is also important to keep in mind the intended audience for the roadmap. It will guide the specific information and the level of detail that it’s appropriate to add to the roadmap.\n\nWhen using the roadmap tool consider the elements and features to track. You can:\n•\tFilter the roadmap by status category (To do, In progress, or Done).\n•\tFilter your roadmap and the issues displayed by an assignee.\n•\tView and edit date ranges.\n•\tAdd new issues on epics.\n•\tAccess settings to adjust your personal view at any time\n•\tZoom in\u002Fout on the roadmap by adjusting the timeline by weeks, months, or quarters.\n\n##Introducing a Jira Roadmap##\n\n![Alt Text](https:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Farticles\u002Fudjgnv3qs8262soo0511.jpg)\n\nSo, what is a product roadmap in Jira and does it require a plugin or app? Agile teams work with the scope and status of work. It is a continuous work in progress that can be visualized with the help of a roadmap. Applying the Jira Software’s roadmap, you let your team attach the stories and tasks in their JIRA project to the actual work on their roadmap.\n\nThe modern JIRA’s model for building software – Jira Software Cloud includes new roadmaps.\n\nThese roadmaps make it easy to sketch out a big-picture strategy and share it with a few simple clicks. With the help of Jira roadmaps, you’ll have a clear view of what big initiatives are underway and how they map to the actual work items in each project.\n\n####What may the JIRA product roadmap include?####\n•\tTimeline (where projects are divided into stages)\n•\tProject goals (in the form of deliverables)\n•\tHigh-level tasks\n•\tSwimlanes\n•\tMilestones\n•\tDependencies\n•\tRisks\n\n![Alt Text](https:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Farticles\u002Fo1y7o9oryrufv89c3lzw.png)\n\nInitially, JIRA had no default roadmap tool functionality. This Agile project management tool had not been designed for long-term planning and was focused on sprint and cadence.\n\nHowever, JIRA proposed to apply a special app and Jira roadmap plugin created by Atlassian – Jira Portfolio or BigPicture plugin that looks even better and provides excellent roadmaps and other project management functionality, for example, risk modules, Gantt charts, or dependency arrows.\n\nThese plugins are really good for collaboration and sharing across your company. Now Jira proposes their users to use a built-in roadmap.\n\nThis roadmap proposed by JIRA serves the purpose of getting all stakeholders on the same page when the process of creating a product roadmap is collaborative. This allows team members to better understand the bigger picture and how their work relates to it.\n\n##Introducing an Improved Alternative – Hygger Roadmap##\n\n![Alt Text](https:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Farticles\u002Fjtmk5j3c957ykh2lkj2p.jpg)\n\nHygger offers a powerful alternative to JIRA’s roadmaps in terms of the design of timelines and their innovative functionality.\nHandy and beautiful Hygger roadmaps will let you plan your goals, strategy, releases, and features with the help of smart timelines and additional features.\n\n![Alt Text](https:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Farticles\u002Fqpthpgcqz28uaiae0e7g.png)\n\n##What Features Do Product Roadmaps in Hygger Provide?##\n\n###Handy templates to save your time###\nYou may choose any template you like, for example:\n•\tProduct roadmap\n•\tProduct development roadmap\n•\tMarketing plan roadmap\n•\tProduct launch roadmap\n•\tPortfolio roadmap, etc.\n\n###Prioritizing for better decisions###\nWith the help of Hygger roadmaps, you can rate features or tasks using ICE, RICE or Weighted Scoring.
