I have started my tech journey when I was in high school and started to deny the fact that it is a male-dominated environment. Now I'm finally feeling that I can raise my voice in my organization freely and my voice has no different than majority groups, however, not every woman or minority in tech has the same environment and that shows that we are not even close to accomplishing equality in 2021. If we are concerned about newly graduated women will eventually face an unconscious bias somewhere in their path until finding the right environment, this means we have a lot to do. If you have never seen any injustice towards women in tech, raise your voice for others, but if you do, you should have been already raised your voice by now with no excuse.
