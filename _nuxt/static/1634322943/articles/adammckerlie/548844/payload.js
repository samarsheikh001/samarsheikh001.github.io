But how do you cultivate this team of peers when your days are filled with 1:1s, meetings, code reviews and other things you need to get done?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEarlier this year I was struggling with this question. I needed to expand and nurture my peer group but was too busy with the day to day tasks of leading multiple teams to do anything regularly. That’s when I found this excellent post on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fblog.danielna.com\u002Fstarting-an-engineering-management-book-club\u002F\"\u003Estarting an engineering manager book club\u003C\u002Fa\u003E by Daniel Na. I asked my peers if they’d be interested in starting a book club for engineering managers. They said yes and I got started thinking about what it could look like.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI wanted the book club to, first and foremost, be a place where we could help one another with challenges in our day to day jobs. Sometimes helping someone is as simple as listening to their problems. Sometimes you have experience and can offer more targeted advice and sometimes people just need to vent. I wanted a place where this could happen freely. I also wanted us to grow as a team, learning new ways to manage our engineers, new techniques to motivate and help grow people’s careers.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving now led a few of these I thought I’d share some tips that have worked well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.

If the group is too big it can make it difficult for a couple of reasons. One reason, logistically speaking, is that it’ll be hard to get everyone a chance to talk in the allotted time. The other problem is a little more nuanced. As the group grows people can be worried about sharing their opinion with a large audience. You may also have someone who dominates the conversation. It’s the job of the moderator to keep the loud ones from \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.psychologytoday.com\u002Fca\u002Fblog\u002Fthe-couch\u002F201204\u002F5-steps-dealing-people-who-talk-too-much\"\u003Etalking too much\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and to get the quiet ones to share their opinions.

You know it’s great and will help others just like it helped you. It’s important to choose the book as a group though because it broadens the potential list of books and gives everyone an opportunity to suggest their favourite book. I asked for people’s favourite management books and then did a Slack poll allowing people to vote for their top three. We then read the most voted on the book. This helped ensure the majority of people were actually interested in the book club and helped with attendance.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.

I planned out every chapter that we’d be reading and scheduled it for the same time every week. We all have busy calendars and planning in advance made it easier to carve out a chunk in everyone’s day. It also helped me plan for days that didn’t work for the majority and allowed me to not have to skip a week because I couldn’t find a time slot that worked.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4.

We found that early mornings before the rush of the day started worked best. People were less likely to have conflicts or meetings that went long and it helped set the tone for the day. I always felt refreshed after the book club, feeling like I could be a better manager to my team.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5.

Some books throw a lot of discussable content into each chapter. Some books have very short chapters with themes that span multiple chapters. Plan the book to read 30-60 pages a week.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6.

I usually find 3 or 4 questions is the right number for an hour-long discussion with &lt;8 people.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIcebreakers are a good way to get everyone comfortable talking. I like asking questions like “What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?” or “What’s the most pressing decision you need to make right now”.
