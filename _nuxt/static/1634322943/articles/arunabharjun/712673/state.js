A product can look awesome and have great functionality, but what brings that x-factor of likability is how the UI and the UX together takes shape of a character that the users can more relate to. Picture this, whenever you think of a doctor, the chances are that an image forms in your head instantly with a person wearing a white coat and a stethoscope hung around their neck. And so is the case when you think of Google, where you think of fun and colorful illustrations &amp; doodles, which are very relatable, or if you take the example of Apple inc. , there are chances that you think of a sophisticated professional environment with itched glass walls and white aesthetics. This is similar to how a mascot becomes the symbol of a sports team. A major role here is being played by the branding associated with the products, and how they are positioned in the market. This helps a company or a product build relatability with the users and ultimately become the first thing that pops in their head when they are trying to accomplish a goal that can be made easy with the help of your product. So while developing your next product, try creating a character out of it, and keeping the UI design in sync with the character. This eventually adds up to a great UX and chances are the users will start seeing your product as a permanent solution to their problem. üéâ\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n  \u003Ca name=\"feedbacks-amp-microinteractions\" href=\"#feedbacks-amp-microinteractions\"\u003E\n  \u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n  ü•ä Feedbacks &amp; Micro-interactions\n\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe third law of Newton states -\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd how can we forget that while making the UX have a more organic feel when we almost constantly are in a touch with this law in real life.

But how do we bring this to the UX of our products? The answer is by very cautiously designing the micro-interactions and the feedbacks that the user will receive while using your product. This really is the most fundamental way to making conversation with your user via your product.
