As seen from the title, this article will cover a topic that I've never written on my blog before - freelancing. I decided to write on this topic due to requests by some of my readers.\n\n### My Experience with Freelancing\nI have been full-time freelancing as a web developer and technical writer since May 2020. With that said, all the tips I am about to give in this article merely comes from personal experience since I am no expert.\n\nIn a span of 6 months, I have negotiated countless rates and have succeeded thanks to these tips I am about to share with you. So, let's get on with those tips!\n\n## 1. Talk about the value not the price\nWhen negotiating your price, it seems obvious to start getting into numbers and debating whether your services deserve $100\u002Fhour or $200\u002Fhour or etc.\n\nThis, however, is the least effective way to negotiate. After all, when you are freelancing, numbers are all subjective.

Try to answer the following questions:\n- Why should `client_name` hire you?\n- How are you different from other developers offering the same services?\n- What can you bring to the table that will help `client_name` grow their business?\n\nIf you understand your worth and value you can bring to your client, it will be easier for you to negotiate a higher rate, because you believe that you deserve it. Your perceived value will naturally be reflected in your confidence and the way you communicate to your client. The client will sense this and will be more willing to offer a higher price.\n\n## 2. Numbers as previous evidences\nAfter determining your value and communicating that to the client, the next step is to use numbers to further persuade the client that your value is worth $x\u002Fhour or $x\u002Fword.\n\nThese numbers include:\n- The rate on your previous clients\n- Number of projects you have done in the past\n\nHaving a solid number allows the client to properly gauge your value. For example, the rate you charged previously was $150\u002Fhour and you have completed 3 projects so far.

That way, the client will more likely accept your price since another client has accepted it too.\n\n## 4. Use the \"We\" language\nIt is important to communicate to your client that you both are on the same side. Instead of saying,\n\u003E \"I need $x\u002Fhour because for me...\"\n\nI often say,\n\u003E \"If it's okay, we can agree on $x\u002Fhour. If not, we can work something out.\"\n\nThat way, the client will not feel that he\u002Fshe has to sacrifice or compromise to get your services. It is more about working together to reach an agreement that both parties will be happy with.
