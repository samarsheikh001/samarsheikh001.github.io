If you like the results we can continue working on other projects.  If you are not happy with the speed of delivery or quality of work at any time, fire me.  We will have deliverables weekly and I'm certain you will be pleasantly surprised at how quickly we can meet and exceed your technology needs.\n\n...\n\nUsually that is enough.  The goal here is to find more details about their goals and project which will give me opportunities to build rapport, learn about their needs, and impress them with my ability to quickly grasp the business aspects and relate them to the technology to come up with innovative solutions they may not have considered yet.  Or if they already have a good grasp of their technology needs this is an opportunity to discuss the tools and methodology I would use to meet those needs.\n\nIf they say \"no thanks\" then the last offer is:\nYou have nothing to lose.  I expect by the end of our tech talk I will outline how to achieve one of your goals.  If you do not think me and my team are right for your needs you will at least have something to talk about with whoever you do end up with.\n\n## Programming Gifts for Clients\nFinal tip on how to keep high-paying clients happy.  There are some kinds of gifts you can give clients that nobody else can.  For each of my clients every year I would build them an analytic report, graph, or widget that would give them a new insight of their business data.  This usually wouldn't take more than 2 or 3 hours to build and I would sometimes showcase some new technology I had discovered. This always leads to gratitude and sometimes leads to new projects.   For example build them a widget that shows how many new visitors and new registrations they had since midnight.  Do this off-the-clock and show it to them during a meeting as a \"thank you\" for their business.  It is quite likely they will say \"Wow, can you make me one that shows those values for last week and last month?\"  Even if they don't, they will appreciate it and it strengthens the relationship.\n\n## Summary\nIn summary, my $180 hourly rate is justified because of:\n\n- breadth of my knowledge\n  - Project Management\n  - Business Analyst\n  - Wide variety of technologies and API integrations\n- full stack developer skills\n  - Primary skills: PHP, SQL, JavaScript\n  - Secondary skills:  HTML5, CSS3, MaterializeCSS\n- fast, efficient, quality code\n  - Coding Standards and Naming Conventions\n  - Wizards Toolkit\n  - Excellent Tool Use - I'm a Macro Master\n\nFor more information about my company Programming Labs:\nhttps:\u002F\u002FProgrammingLabs.com\n\nFor more information and to sign up as an early adopter for Wizards Toolkit:\nhttps:\u002F\u002FWizardsToolkit.com";c.user={name:"Alec",username:"alecbsherman",twitter_username:"AlecBSherman",github_username:a,website_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fprogramminglabs.com\u002F",profile_image:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fpracticaldev\u002Fimage\u002Ffetch\u002Fs--JEPDzJKj--\u002Fc_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_640,q_auto,w_640\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Fuser\u002Fprofile_image\u002F608181\u002F7a63e431-8ea8-4c3b-9105-8d8c6aa393cf.jpg",profile_image_90:"https:\u002F\u002Fres.cloudinary.com\u002Fpracticaldev\u002Fimage\u002Ffetch\u002Fs--tojCQfsU--\u002Fc_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_90,q_auto,w_90\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com\u002Fuploads\u002Fuser\u002Fprofile_image\u002F608181\u002F7a63e431-8ea8-4c3b-9105-8d8c6aa393cf.jpg"};return {data:[{}],fetch:{"data-v-25febe66:0":{article:c}},mutations:[["SET_CURRENT_ARTICLE",c]]}}(null,"2021-08-03T16:47:12Z",{},"https:\u002F\u002Fdev.to\u002Falecbsherman\u002F180-per-hour-programming-3gp0",13)));
