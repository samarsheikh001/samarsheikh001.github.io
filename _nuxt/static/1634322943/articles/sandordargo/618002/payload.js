It's about small teams for small ***software*** problems.\n\nHence the author is not really fond of those scaled agile frameworks. They might work, but he hasn't seen a lot - this is kind of the same thing that [Nicolas Chaillan](https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FNicolasChaillan) Chief Software Officer of the US Air Force said about [scaled agile frameworks](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.smharter.com\u002Fblog\u002Fsafe-a-collection-of-comments-from-leading-experts\u002F).\n\nHence, the agile he talks about throughout the book is not the scaled one.\n\n## Agile without technical practices is not agile\n\nThe agile he talks about is also not the one without technical practices. \"Any attempt to employ Agile practices without the technical practices is doomed to fail.\" As one of the agile coaches I worked with said, people who delivered crap before working in scrum, will deliver the same crap within scrum too...
