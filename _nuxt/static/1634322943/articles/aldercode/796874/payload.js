It's still very early days for my freelancing career. The weekly updates will include way more detail than I'd tend to share in blog posts usually. \n\nLearning from my learnings.\n\nSeeing the results of outreach and discovering what it's **actually** like out there.\n\nLearning the process from contact to brief to delivery... and on to invoicing.\n\nSound interesting? If so, be sure to check out the [Gumroad page](https:\u002F\u002Faldercode.gumroad.com\u002Fl\u002Fgoingfreelance) for more details.\n\n### Will it work? ###\n\nI have **no** idea. But, I'm happy to find out.\n\nI'm going to be doing the work whether or not folks sign up and join me. I may as well unpack the lessons learned along the way with the wider world instead of stacking them all up and only releasing my magnum opus ðŸ˜‰ in a year.\n\nPersonally, I love grasping opportunities to find out as much as I can about freelancing from wherever I can, i.e. really getting into the finer details. \n\nHopefully, this helps someone else on their path to freelancing and financial success.\n\nTime will tell.\n\nGot any thoughts on this? I'd love to hear them. Drop a comment below and let's chat.\n\nWatch this space for feedback on how it all goes.\n\n---\nEnjoyed the post?
