Later I tried implementing it on my project, while those implementation period I firstly tried custom coding it. During that point I realised its pretty tough to code for a Toast animation because there are infinite number of possible ways you can use it. Due to this I went on with some popular Swift libraries which were used to implement the same. But like every library those libraries were really heavy and unoptimised. This made me really frustrated. So I thought why not try a hands-on by creating a library for this.  Since every user wants to use a small and highly optimised Library I went on creating Loafjet. So Loafjet is a highly optimised and most lightly available toast framework which you can get currently. On an estimate the Loafjet file consumes about 21kb of your project. Isn't it really amazing, 21kbüî•. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Ch1\u003E\n  \u003Ca name=\"features\" href=\"#features\" class=\"anchor\"\u003E\n  \u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n  Features üöÄ\n\u003C\u002Fh1\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo Loafjet provides user to create their own Loaf with various types of customisation. Loafjet provides infinite number of Loaf variation. Yup, you heard it correct, Using Loafjet you can customise your loaf with the most possible ways. The best part is you can add your desired animation direction. Loafjet comes with preset of animation directions which are most popularly used. Here also it doesn't stops, Loafjet provides you an option to add Gradient background to your Loaf. Wait...wait.. the surprise isn't over, while creating this library I thought why not make it more unique by providing additional supports. So with this I went on creating a new support system for Loafjet which is called The Loafjet+.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E\n  \u003Ca name=\"what-is-loafjet-\" href=\"#what-is-loafjet-\" class=\"anchor\"\u003E\n  \u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n  What is Loafjet+ ?\n\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELoafjet+ is an additional support system which helps you to add customised Popup Card and Activity Indicator.
