The tower itself seems to writhe and twist, as though it is alive and struggling against the elements. / The Citadel of Suffering is a place of unspeakable horror. Show a dark, claustrophobic hallway within the tower, lit only by flickering torches. The walls are slick with red ooze and other oozing fluids, and strange noises echo through the darkness. Use deep shadows and warm lighting to create a sense of danger and the unknown.** - Upscaled by <@1016287988172456007> (fast)","attachments":[{"id":"1079883652667818044","filename":"Adventure_University_The_Citadel_of_Suffering_looms_high_above__e22f160d-bd9e-4941-ae00-deac65947072.png","size":1460921,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1008571105990160476/1079883652667818044/Adventure_University_The_Citadel_of_Suffering_looms_high_above__e22f160d-bd9e-4941-ae00-deac65947072.png","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008571105990160476/1079883652667818044/Adventure_University_The_Citadel_of_Suffering_looms_high_above__e22f160d-bd9e-4941-ae00-deac65947072.png","width":1024,"height":1024,"content_type":"image/png"}]},{"id":"1079883588155211826","content":"**cute baby dinosaur, doing crochet, a lot of crochet spread, relax, high quality** - Upscaled by <@759609216112787456> (fast)","attachments":[{"id":"1079883587815489566","filename":"Claudia_Danitza_cute_baby_dinosaur_doing_crochet_a_lot_of_croch_25378c74-113c-4630-b681-fc16a1bd7de5.png","size":1187598,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1008571105990160476/1079883587815489566/Claudia_Danitza_cute_baby_dinosaur_doing_crochet_a_lot_of_croch_25378c74-113c-4630-b681-fc16a1bd7de5.png","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008571105990160476/1079883587815489566/Claudia_Danitza_cute_baby_dinosaur_doing_crochet_a_lot_of_croch_25378c74-113c-4630-b681-fc16a1bd7de5.png","width":1024,"height":1024,"content_type":"image/png"}]},{"id":"1079883567217254450","content":"**cute baby dinosaur, doing crochet, a lot of crochet spread, relax, high quality** - Upscaled by <@759609216112787456> (fast)","attachments":[{"id":"1079883566831390742","filename":"Claudia_Danitza_cute_baby_dinosaur_doing_crochet_a_lot_of_croch_ee5a4a02-989f-455e-af2a-8966ee0cf14c.png","size":1213331,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1008571105990160476/1079883566831390742/Claudia_Danitza_cute_baby_dinosaur_doing_crochet_a_lot_of_croch_ee5a4a02-989f-455e-af2a-8966ee0cf14c.png","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008571105990160476/1079883566831390742/Claudia_Danitza_cute_baby_dinosaur_doing_crochet_a_lot_of_croch_ee5a4a02-989f-455e-af2a-8966ee0cf14c.png","width":1024,"height":1024,"content_type":"image/png"}]},{"id":"1079883403123490906","content":"**<https://s.mj.run/pcSfO0AcUXw> Gir is a severely wounded robot in battle and is saluting to demonstrate he is ready for more, upcale realistic, cinematic, ambient occlusion, ray tracing global illumination, detailed face, portrait style, CGI, artificial intelligence, glorified detail, 4k** - Upscaled by <@424299050850975745> (fast)","attachments":[{"id":"1079883402888613908","filename":"Droski_Gir_is_a_severely_wounded_robot_in_battle_and_is_saluti_d5db619a-5693-4a47-99fe-694556de81cf.png","size":845948,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1008571105990160476/1079883402888613908/Droski_Gir_is_a_severely_wounded_robot_in_battle_and_is_saluti_d5db619a-5693-4a47-99fe-694556de81cf.png","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008571105990160476/1079883402888613908/Droski_Gir_is_a_severely_wounded_robot_in_battle_and_is_saluti_d5db619a-5693-4a47-99fe-694556de81cf.png","width":1024,"height":1024,"content_type":"image/png"}]},{"id":"1079883371259371631","content":"**<https://s.mj.run/3k0CAQBRYNg> as a soldier high quality** - Upscaled by <@1074465888117469273> (fast)","attachments":[{"id":"1079883370923839539","filename":"Fifek_as_a_soldier_high_quality_675b93da-5de4-4cdd-b9e1-87617c0ff17c.png","size":1239499,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1008571105990160476/1079883370923839539/Fifek_as_a_soldier_high_quality_675b93da-5de4-4cdd-b9e1-87617c0ff17c.png","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1008571105990160476/1079883370923839539/Fifek_as_a_soldier_high_quality_675b93da-5de4-4cdd-b9e1-87617c0ff17c.png","width":1024,"height":1024,"content_type":"image/png"}]},{"id":"1079883316469190736","content":"**Ultra-detailed, hyper-realistic, 3D architectural rendering with perfect cinematic lighting of: A 360 degree fully immersive & interactive contemporary art installation in style with Machine Memoirs: Space by Refik Anadol that uses cameras & the holodeck from star trek that uses ultra-high definition ultra-realistic LED screens which account for the walls, ceiling, and floor of the space along with sensors that collect movement data from participants, then using a combination of chaos game algorithm, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and reinforcement learning to visualize that movement data into a work of art that perpetually evolves through the act of observation. Process: Applying principles of holographic reduction and fractals to create a work of art that perpetually evolves through the act of observation. The model would involve collecting movement data using sensors and cameras, and feeding that data into the chaos game algorithm to generate the initial 12D fractal pattern. This is then refined using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which has been pre-trained on a large dataset of fractal patterns and optimized through reinforcement learning. The refined pattern is further optimized using genetic algorithms, which evolve the chaos game algorithm to generate more optimal patterns that match that movement data. Ultimately, as more and more data is collected the 12D fractal patterns will evolve to create an even more immersive 12D environment made of these fractal patterns, this further evolves to create digital organisms who inhabit this environment, these unique digital life forms which evolve into humanoid beings which interact with the observers within the installation.
